# Twitter-SMS-Sender

#### About

The purpose of this project is to monitor a Twitter account and send an SMS when key-words are included in the tweet. I created this to monitor Elon Musk's account and send me an SMS to notify me if he mentions certain cryptocurrecnies.

#### How to use

- Create a new Twitter application and generate consumer key and access token. Put these in config.py (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/obtaining-user-access-tokens)
- Create a txtlocal account and obtain username, sender and API hash. Put these in config.py along with the number(s) you want to send to. The first 5 texts are sent free.
- Get the Twitter user_id of the account you want to monitor
